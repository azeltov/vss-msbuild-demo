# Insurance Claims Triage — Foundry hosted agent

A [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) hosted agent that orchestrates the **NVIDIA VSS Agent** as a video-understanding sub-agent, plus three mock business tools, to turn a customer's damage video into a draft insurance claim.

## What the agent does

When given a customer message like:

> "A customer just submitted a damage video. `video_id=302857`. If the VIN is not visible, use policy POL-2025-44912 as fallback. Run the triage workflow."

the agent executes this chain:

1. **`vss_analyze_video(video_id, question)`** — calls the NVIDIA VSS Agent on AKS (cosmos-reason2-8b VLM) for damage analysis
2. **`lookup_policy(vin? | policy_number?)`** — mock policy DB ([sample_data/policies.json](sample_data/policies.json))
3. **`estimate_repair_cost(damage_items)`** — parts + labor calculator
4. **`draft_claim_pdf(...)`** — reportlab PDF written to `./output/CLM-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX.pdf`

Then replies with a concise claim summary including the payable amount after deductible.

See [tools.py](tools.py) for tool implementations and [instructions.md](instructions.md) for the system prompt.

## Iterate locally — no `azd deploy` required

Once your Foundry project is provisioned (one-time `azd provision`, see step 4
below), the iterative dev loop runs **the agent process on your laptop** while
the model inference still uses Foundry. No container build, no ACR push, no
hosted endpoint — just `python main.py` under the covers, exposed as
`localhost:8088`.

```bash
cd demo/insurance-claims-foundry

# Terminal 1 — start the agent (binds :8088, leave running)
azd ai agent run

# Terminal 2 — invoke with the canonical smoke-test prompt
azd ai agent invoke --local \
  "A customer just submitted a damage video. video_id=302857. \
   If the VIN is not visible, use policy POL-2025-44912 as a fallback. \
   Run the triage workflow."
```

Verified end-to-end output (Pexels clip 302857 — wrecked Camry):

```
Claim drafted: CLM-YYYYMMDD-44912
Vehicle: 2022 Toyota Camry SE (VIN 4T1G11AK7NU012345)
Damage:  Severe damage to hood and windshield;
         moderate damage to front bumper and driver door.
Repair:  $5982    Deductible: $500    Payable: $5482
Draft saved to: ./output/CLM-YYYYMMDD-44912.pdf
```

`azd ai agent run` reads env vars from `.azure/<env>/.env` (populated by
`azd provision`) and from [agent.yaml](agent.yaml)'s `environment_variables`
block (which carries `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` and `VSS_BASE_URL`). It also
auto-maps `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` → `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`.

When you're ready to publish the agent to Foundry as a real hosted container,
see [Deploying to Foundry (production hosted)](#deploying-to-foundry-production-hosted)
below. The full walk-through (install extension → provision → upgrade
model → local run) is in [Reproduce the local run](#reproduce-the-local-run).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| Azure subscription with `Contributor` (or equivalent) at sub scope | `azd provision` creates RG + Foundry resource + ACR + Log Analytics + App Insights + model deployment |
| `azd` CLI **≥ 1.24.0** | Hosted-agent commands |
| `azd ai agent` extension **≥ 0.1.27-preview** | New hosted-agents backend (not the legacy Container Apps experience) |
| Python **3.10+** local | `azd ai agent run` creates a venv and installs `requirements.txt` |
| `az login` done | `DefaultAzureCredential` uses your CLI session for Foundry auth |
| VSS Agent reachable | The `VSS_BASE_URL` env var (set in [agent.yaml](agent.yaml)) must resolve. Demo default: `http://vss.104.45.71.11.nip.io` — replace with your own AKS deployment per the workshop's [main README](../../../../README.md) |

## Reproduce the local run

These steps reproduce the working local smoke test exactly.

### 1. Install / upgrade the `azd ai agent` extension

```bash
azd ext install azure.ai.agents   # first time
azd ext upgrade azure.ai.agents   # if already installed (needs >= 0.1.27-preview)
azd ext list | grep ai.agents     # verify
```

### 2. Clone this workshop repo and `cd` to the agent project root

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd <repo-root>/demo/insurance-claims-foundry
```

> If you want to re-scaffold from scratch instead of cloning: run `azd ai agent init` in an empty directory, pick `Python` / `Basic agent (Responses, Agent Framework, Python)` / `Deploy a new model in Foundry`, then copy [tools.py](tools.py), [instructions.md](instructions.md), [sample_data/](sample_data/), and the `VSS_BASE_URL` env entry from [agent.yaml](agent.yaml) into the new project.

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
az login
azd auth login
```

### 4. Provision Azure resources

```bash
azd provision
```

About 90 seconds. Creates:

- Resource group `rg-insurance-claims-foundry-dev` (or whatever env name you picked)
- Foundry account `ai-account-<suffix>`
- Foundry project `ai-project-insurance-claims-foundry-dev`
- Default model deployment (`gpt-4.1-mini` from `azd ai agent init`)
- Azure Container Registry `cr<suffix>` (Basic SKU)
- Log Analytics workspace + Application Insights

### 5. Deploy a stronger model (recommended)

`gpt-4.1-mini` (the default) hallucinates tool calls in this multi-step orchestration. Deploy `gpt-4.1` (full) and switch the agent to use it:

```bash
RG=$(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d'"' -f2)
ACCT=$(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME | cut -d'"' -f2)

az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
  -g "$RG" -n "$ACCT" \
  --deployment-name gpt-4.1 \
  --model-name gpt-4.1 \
  --model-version 2025-04-14 \
  --model-format OpenAI \
  --sku-capacity 50 --sku-name Standard
```

Then point the agent at it:

```bash
# Edit agent.yaml: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT value: gpt-4.1
# Edit .azure/<env>/.env: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4.1"
```

Or run from this directory:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT gpt-4.1
sed -i.bak 's/value: gpt-4.1-mini/value: gpt-4.1/' agent.yaml && rm agent.yaml.bak
```

### 6. Start the agent locally

In one terminal:

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The first run creates a venv and pip-installs `requirements.txt` (~30s). Then logs:

```
Running on http://0.0.0.0:8088 (CTRL + C to quit)
```

Leave this running.

### 7. Invoke with the sample prompt

In another terminal:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "A customer just submitted a damage video. video_id=302857. If the VIN is not visible, use policy POL-2025-44912 as a fallback. Run the triage workflow."
```

You should see the agent execute `vss_analyze_video` → `lookup_policy` → `estimate_repair_cost` → `draft_claim_pdf`, then a final claim summary. The PDF is written to `./output/CLM-*.pdf`.

### 8. Send your own test (curl)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "video_id=302857, policy POL-2025-44912 — run triage", "stream": false}'
```

### Multi-turn

Pass the response ID from the previous reply to continue the conversation:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Now resubmit with policy POL-2025-58820 instead.", "previous_response_id": "<id>"}'
```

## Sample videos

The default `VSS_BASE_URL` points at the workshop's AKS-hosted VSS Agent. The two videos that have been pre-uploaded and used in smoke tests:

| video_id | Description | Suggested fallback policy |
|---|---|---|
| `302857` | Pexels clip 302857 — wrecked car on graffiti street, severe front collision | `POL-2025-44912` (Alex Romero / Camry) |
| `3974558-hd_1920_1080_30fps` | Pexels clip 3974558 — HD front-end collision walkaround | `POL-2025-58820` (Priya Shankar / Civic) |

To upload your own video to VST first, see the wrapper's [`vss_upload_video`](../../../insurance-claims/vss_mcp_server.py) helper in the sibling demo folder, or use the VST API directly:

```bash
# 1. Get a presigned upload URL
curl -sS -X POST http://vss.<EXTERNAL_HOST>.nip.io/api/v1/videos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"my-claim.mp4"}'

# 2. PUT your video bytes to the returned URL
curl -X PUT "<presigned-url>" --data-binary @my-claim.mp4 -H "Content-Type: video/mp4"

# 3. Reference the returned video_id when chatting with the agent
```

## Troubleshooting local runs

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Maximum consecutive function call errors reached (3)` | Model is hallucinating tool args. Switch from gpt-4.1-mini to gpt-4.1 (see step 5). |
| Agent claims a PDF was saved but no file exists | Same as above — model fabricated the tool call. Hardened instructions in [instructions.md](instructions.md) step 6 explicitly forbid this; if you regress, the file in `output/` will be missing. |
| `port 8088 already in use` | Another agent is running. `pkill -f "python main.py"` or use a different port via the agent SDK config. |
| `DefaultAzureCredential` failure | Run `azd auth logout && azd auth login` and `az login` again. |
| VSS analysis returns prose with `<agent-think>` tags | Wrapper should strip them — see [tools.py](tools.py) `_AGENT_THINK_RE`. If you see them in output, check that regex is being applied. |
| `ResourceNotFound` on `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | `azd ai agent run` should auto-map `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` → `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`. If not, `cp .env.example .env` and set both manually. |

## Test harness — deployed agent

End-to-end smoke test under [../../tests/](../../tests/) that drives the
**deployed** Foundry hosted agent (no `--local`). It shells out to
`azd ai agent invoke --new-conversation "..."` and asserts that the
response includes a drafted claim with the expected vehicle / VIN / dollar
amount.

### Enable

Test config lives in the repo-root [.env.test](../../../../.env.test).
Set the remote-suite gate:

```bash
RUN_E2E_REMOTE_TESTS=1
```

(see [.env.test.example](../../../../.env.test.example) for the full
template). The local-runner gate `RUN_E2E_TESTS` for the sibling
`insurance-claims/` demo is independent — you can enable one suite without
the other.

### Run

```bash
cd demo/insurance-claims-foundry
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt    # pytest + python-dotenv
pytest tests/ -v -s
```

### Skip behavior

Plain `pytest tests/` is safe — the test is skipped when any of these are true:

- `RUN_E2E_REMOTE_TESTS` is unset
- `azd` CLI isn't on PATH
- No deployed agent in the current azd env (run `azd deploy` first)

Each run costs ~30-90s of model + VSS spend, so the gate stays off by
default. See the App Insights trace (linked from invoke output) for the
full tool-call sequence — `azd ai agent invoke` stdout only carries the
final response text, not individual tool calls.

## Deploying to Foundry (production hosted)

Once the local run works:

```bash
azd deploy
```

This:
1. Tars up the `src/agent-framework-agent-basic-responses/` directory
2. Uploads to ACR
3. ACR Tasks builds the Dockerfile remotely (no local Docker required)
4. Pushes the image
5. Registers the agent against the Foundry project + starts the container
6. **Postdeploy hook** grants the agent's managed identity the runtime RBAC it needs (storage/history + agent endpoint)

Then invoke production (no `--local` flag):

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "video_id=302857, policy POL-2025-44912 — run triage"
```

Find the agent in the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) → your project → **Build** → **Agents**. Traces stream to the Application Insights resource in the same RG.

### ⚠ Required: keep `azure.yaml` service name == `agent.yaml` name

The `azd deploy` postdeploy hook fetches the agent's metadata using the **service name from `azure.yaml`**, then grants the agent identity its runtime RBAC. If your `agent.yaml` `name:` differs from the `azure.yaml` `services.<name>:` key, the postdeploy hook gets a **404**, the RBAC step never runs, and **all subsequent invocations fail with HTTP 500 `PermissionDenied`** on the `storage/history` endpoint.

In this project both are `insurance-claims-triage`. If you rename one, rename the other in the same commit.

Symptoms if they drift:
```
ERROR: failed invoking event handlers for 'postdeploy', failed to fetch agent version for <service-name>/1: 404 Not Found
```
…followed by every invoke returning:
```
{"error":{"code":"PermissionDenied","message":"Principal does not have access to API/Operation."}}
```

### Container filesystem and output artifacts

The agent container has its own filesystem at `/app/user_agent/`. PDFs the agent generates via `draft_claim_pdf` land in `/app/user_agent/output/` **inside the container** — not on the caller's machine. Per the [hosted-agent docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents), sessions persist their filesystem for up to 30 days, accessible via the Foundry portal session-files panel.

For a real workflow, replace the file-write in `draft_claim_pdf` with an upload to Blob Storage (or a SharePoint connection) so adjusters can fetch the PDF.

## Cleanup

```bash
azd down       # deletes the entire RG (Foundry, ACR, monitoring, model deployments — all of it)
```

> ⚠ `azd down` removes everything in the RG. If you reuse this RG for anything else, delete resources individually instead.
